Abex's Idle Notifier
====================

This just works by checking if the last thing you clicked on hasn't despawned. This makes it almost instant, 
but if you click on basically anything (even parts of the ui) it won't work. It only works on `Mine` options,
but it probably could be extended to trees pretty easily.
